</ul>

### Bugs & Errors:


## User Experience (UX)

### Design:
<ul>
  <li>Colour Scheme:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The colour scheme is quite powerful and attractive to the user. The palette consists of black, earth yellow, white and dark red. All four colours create a strong yet vulnerable combination. I wanted colours that represented the name of the brand, Flash Empire, as much as possible. The black and dark red are seen as strong and powerful (Empire), the earth yellow is almost like a gold that represents royalty, wealth (Empire) and the white is used to create a sense of light (Flash) and vulnerability.</li>
  </ul>
    <li>Navigation:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The navigation is very modern and efficient. There's very little content within the nav, this makes it easy for the user to navigate round the site.</li>
  </ul>
    <li>Icons:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>There are many icons on the app. Icons indicate what the content consists of and/or what it carries out (ex.trash bin indicates remove).</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
